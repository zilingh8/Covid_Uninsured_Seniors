"The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage.  For example, a person reporting having Medicaid coverage and another type of coverage would be categorized as having Medicaid coverage in this analysis. * The count of people with Medicare excludes those who report having both Medicare and Medicaid coverage, also known as dual eligibles. If these individuals were instead categorized as having Medicare, the total number of people with Medicare would increase as follows:<br>      - 2018: from 43,837,300 to 54,685,100</br><br>      - 2017: from 42,802,900 to 53,401,400</br><br>      - 2016: from 41,628,600 to 52,099,100</br><br>      - 2015: from 40,558,200 to 50,747,800</br><br>      - 2014: from 39,364,700 to 49,231,400</br><br>      - 2013: from 37,939,800 to 47,515,000</br><br>      - 2012: from 36,470,400 to 46,081,400</br><br>      - 2011: from 35,074,700 to 44,427,200</br><br>      - 2010: from 34,335,100 to 43,246,000</br><br>      - 2009: from 33,037,500 to 41,876,400</br><br>      - 2008: from 32,115,800 to 39,037,500</br><br> Data may not sum to totals due to rounding.

"Georgia: On March 27, 2019, Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed The Patients First Act, which aimed to address challenges in healthcare including the state’s high uninsured rates. The bill authorized the Georgia Department of Community Health to submit a Section 1115 waiver request that could include a Medicaid expansion limited to coverage up to 100% FPL. The bill allocated funds which the Department used to contract with Deloitte to develop this waiver request as well as potential Section 1332 waiver requests. In accordance with the March legislation, on October 31, 2019, Kemp released a proposed 1332 waiver seeking to implement a reinsurance program and make other changes to marketplace coverage. On November 4, 2019 his office released a proposed 1115 waiver called Georgia Pathways to Coverage which would expand Medicaid coverage to 100% FPL and requests the enhanced ACA funding match despite a July [statement](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-statement-partial-medicaid-expansion-policy) from CMS indicating that it will not provide this match for partial expansions.

"Idaho: Idaho voters approved a ballot measure in November 2018 that requires the state to submit a state plan amendment (SPA) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to implement the Medicaid expansion within 90 days of approval of the measure. Idaho submitted a SPA for the Medicaid expansion in February 2019. On April 9, 2019, Idaho Governor Little signed a bill passed by the legislature that makes changes to the Medicaid expansion program approved by voters. The legislation directs the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek waivers for multiple changes, including to add a work requirement as a condition of eligibility for coverage. The legislation specifies that if the waivers are not approved by January 1, 2020, then all individuals up to 138% FPL will be enrolled in Medicaid. Enrollment in Medicaid coverage under expansion began on November 1, 2019, and coverage for these enrollees began on January 1, 2020.

"Kansas: Medicaid expansion passed in the Kansas legislature in 2017, but was vetoed by Republican Sam Brownback, the Governor at the time. In 2018, Democratic Governor Laura Kelly ran for office on the issue of expansion, but Republican leaders in the 2019 session blocked her expansion bill from a vote in the Senate despite its passage in the House on March 20, 2019. On October 23, 2019, Republican Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning proposed his own version of Medicaid expansion, which the Senate Select Committee on Healthcare Access recommended get further study in the 2020 legislative session. On January 9, 2020, Kelly and Denning announced a bipartisan Medicaid expansion bill that compromises between the 2017 bill vetoed by Brownback, the 2019 bill adopted by the House, and Denning’s October plan. The bill would expand Medicaid by January 1, 2021 and would fund the state’s share of the cost with a capped surcharge on hospitals. In addition to provisions such as premiums and a work referral program, the bill also directs the state to apply for waivers that would transition those between 100-138% of the FPL from Medicaid expansion coverage to Marketplace coverage, although the expansion is not contingent on approval of these waivers. The Senate bill is co-sponsored by 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats, and House members from both parties have expressed their support as well. Republican President Susan Wagle stalled the bill’s progress, however, by pledging not to allow a vote on expansion until an anti-abortion bill passed the House. The 2020 legislative session ended with no further progress on the bill after Democrats tried to force a vote on Medicaid expansion and failed on May 21, 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"South Dakota: In May 2019, the group South Dakota Community Action submitted a Medicaid expansion ballot initiative measure to the state’s Legislative Research Council for review. On June 3, 2019, the Council responded that the measure satisfied the process for review and directed South Dakota Community Action to re-submit the final measure for a fiscal estimate; the initiative has not progressed since. On April 17, 2020, the South Dakota Democratic Party released a [statement](https://sddp.org/stronger-measures-needed-for-covid-19-effects/) urging Republican Governor Kristi Noem to consider expanding Medicaid via Executive Order to address the COVID-19 pandemic by increasing access to health care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Utah: Since Utah voters approved a November 2018 ballot measure to adopt the ACA Medicaid expansion up to 138% of the FPL, the state legislature has taken steps to roll back the full expansion. The state enacted a law in February 2019 that amended the voter-approved ballot measure, requiring the state to submit a series of Section 1115 waiver requests limiting the expansion to 100% FPL, first at its regular matching rate and then requesting the enhanced federal matching rate of 90%. The first waiver, the ""Bridge Plan,"" was approved in March 2019, and allowed the state to implement a coverage expansion to 100% FPL beginning April 1, 2019, at the state’s regular matching rate. In accordance with the legislation, the state also submitted to CMS its ""Per Capita Cap"" waiver on July 31, 2019 and subsequently its ""Fallback Plan"" waiver on November 4, 2019. On December 23, 2019, CMS approved the Fallback Plan waiver’s request to expand Medicaid eligibility to 138% FPL, effective January 1, 2020. CMS also approved several other requests from this waiver, including work requirements for the newly-expanded adult Medicaid population, but did not approve the request to cap enrollment. CMS is continuing to review numerous other provisions in the Fallback Plan waiver.,Coverage under the Medicaid expansion became effective January 1, 2014 in all states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion except for the following: Michigan (4/1/2014), New Hampshire (8/15/2014), Pennsylvania (1/1/2015), Indiana (2/1/2015), Alaska (9/1/2015), Montana (1/1/2016), Louisiana (7/1/2016), Virginia (1/1/2019), Maine (1/10/2019 with coverage retroactive to 7/2/2018), Idaho (1/1/2020), Utah (1/1/2020), Nebraska (planned for 10/1/2020), and Oklahoma (planned for 7/1/2021 or earlier).,Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, and Utah have approved Section 1115 waivers to operate their Medicaid expansion programs in ways not otherwise allowed under federal law. Arkansas continues to operate its expansion program through a waiver, however, the waiver provisions related to the work requirement and reduction of retroactive eligibility were set aside by court on March 27, 2019.

"Virginia: The Virginia General Assembly approved Medicaid expansion as part of its FY 2019-2020 budget on May 30, 2018; Governor Northam signed the budget into law on June 7, 2018.

"Wyoming: On November 12, 2019, the Wyoming legislature’s Joint Revenue Committee voted to move forward a Medicaid expansion bill to the full legislature. If passed, the bill would allow the Governor to direct state agencies to consider options for Medicaid expansion and then, if expansion is recommended, to direct the Health Department to submit an expansion plan to CMS with the Legislature’s approval. At the beginning of the legislature’s 2020 session on February 10, 2020, however, the House voted against including the bill on its consent agenda. A bill filed on February 13, 2020 by Republican Representative Pat Sweeney to put a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid on the November 2020 ballot also failed in the House on February 14, 2020. The Legislature may revisit the topic, however: at a meeting focused on addressing the COVID-19 crisis on May 8, 2020 lawmakers voted to make Medicaid expansion a priority discussion topic for the Joint Revenue Committee in upcoming months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A central goal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to significantly reduce the number of uninsured by providing a continuum of affordable coverage options through Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. The ACA expands Medicaid coverage for most low-income adults to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL); see this [table](http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/medicaid-income-eligibility-limits-for-adults-as-a-percent-of-the-federal-poverty-level-january-2015/) for state by state Medicaid income eligibility levels for adults.

Nonelderly Uninsured by Federal Poverty Level (FPL),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by the Kaiser Family Foundation. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates.  In this analysis, income (mostly categorized as a percent of the federal poverty level) is aggregated by Census-defined family units. Analyzing income by family unit captures income available to a group of people who are likely sharing resources. However, family units may not be the appropriate measure for capturing eligibility for health insurance. Eligibility for health insurance is more accurately estimated using ""health insurance units,"" which may be counted differently for different types of insurance (such as Medicaid or employer coverage). The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage.  A person reporting having Medicaid coverage and another type of coverage would be categorized as having Medicaid coverage in this analysis. Data may not sum to totals due to rounding. The U.S. Census Bureau's poverty threshold for a family with two adults and one child was $20,212 in 2018. This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid. For more information on measures of poverty, please see the detailed description provided by HHS: [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm).
