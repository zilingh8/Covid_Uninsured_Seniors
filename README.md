# Covid_Uninsured_Seniors

This is a group school project where we explore the relationship between state demographics and Covid transmission and mortality rates.
We discussed as a group and agreed on the questions for our research based on interest.
The goal of the project is to write a report and presentation showcasing our findings after performing EDA, visualizations and analysis. 

I have included the code I wrote for question 3 and question 4 of the project.

* Question 3 :What is the relationship between mortality rate, infection rate and the percentage of seniors and children living in the same household?

* Question 4 : How does health insurance coverage correlate with mortality rate and infection rate?


The files in the repo are as follows:

* Covid-19 Analysis PPT : This is the slide deck we worked on as a group to present the results of our analysis
* Covid-19 Analysis Report : This is our write-up of our findings through correlation heatmaps, charts and references to any literature we used.
* Code and Datasets: You will find a Q3_Q4_plots.ipynb file of the code where I used numpy, pandas and seaborn to clean data, explore, merge tables and create visualization as well as comments on the datasets used and their components. The datasets were taken from various datasources such as John Hopkins and the Kaiser Family Foundation.
